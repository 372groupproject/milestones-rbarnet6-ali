# milestones-rbarnet6-ali
milestones-rbarnet6-ali created by GitHub Classroom
Authors: Ali (paper and video) and Ray (physics sim program).

The final paper (broken 5 milestones) are all under the ClojureCode. As well as the raw code.

Note by Ali To the grader,
Ray and I had a miscommunication and a change of languages (from WebAssembly to Clojure).
I, Ali, was responsible for the delays of all milestones. 
I was hesitant about dropping the class (this was before Corona scare). Ray should NOT be penalized for it. Just me.
That being said, I did my 50% albeit late. I NEVER FREELOAD
